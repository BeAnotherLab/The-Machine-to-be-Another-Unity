I felt as if the body I saw when looking down was my own body
I felt as if the body I saw when looking down was someone else
I felt somehow connected with the body that I saw when looking down
Sometimes it felt like I and the body that I saw when looking down were one
The movements of the body I saw when looking down were caused by my movements
It felt like I could control the body I saw when looking down as if it was my own
It felt as if my movements were controlled by someone else
I felt as if my body was located where the body I saw when looking down was
It seemed as if the touch I felt was caused by the experimenter touching the body that I saw when looking down
It seemed as if I felt the touch of the experimenter in the location where I saw the body when looking down being touched
I felt like I was wearing different clothes from when I came to the laboratory
It felt as if my real body were turning into another person's
It felt as if someone elses body turned into mine
My movements were synchronous those of the body that I saw when looking down
When someone touched the body I saw when looking down I simultaneously felt the touch
